### About Me
I started writing poems when I was very young, and as you might expect, they were not very good.
But through years of practice and some knowledge of music, I was able to make the poems into something that I want to share with people.

> I try to capture those fleeting moments in life and save them as songs.

I hope you connect with my songs and find them interesting. Cheers!
